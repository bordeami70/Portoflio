```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


this is my final project portfolio for CIS 631

course objectives looking to demonstrate:

-Describe probability as a foundation of statistical modeling, including inference and maximum likelihood estimation

-Determine and apply the appropriate generalized linear model for a specific data context

linear, trying to fit some sort of a line for some link function 
explore the data and then say the data means this so thats why I chose this model


-Conduct model selection for a set of candidate models


-Communicate the results of statistical models to a general audience


-Use programming software (i.e., R) to fit and assess statistical models
** will demonstrate with this portfolio project being coded in R


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
